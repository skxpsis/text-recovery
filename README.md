How to recover recently lost text via browser.

Scenario: You're enrolled in a class and have to partake in dicussions via online forum. When typing out your discussion response in a shitty text box, your connection to your institution is disrupted, or you accidentally navigate away from the page. Either way, something happened and you lost all your work. This happened to me, and this is how I retrieved all my lost work.

Conditions:
- Important: Browser tab in which the text was lost can not be closed
- **Testing underway to see if this works for closed tabs**
- OS: Windows 10
- **Testing underway to see if this works for Windows 11 builds**
- Browser: Google Chrome Version 94.0.4606.81 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- May work on previous versions of browser or OS but cannot confirm
