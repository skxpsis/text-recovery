How to recover recently lost text via browser.

Scenario: You're enrolled in a class and have to partake in dicussions via online forum. When typing our your discussion response, your connection to your institution is disrupted, or you accidentally navigate away from the page. Either way, something happened and you lost all your work. This trick helped me retrieve my data.

Conditions:
- Important: Browser tab in which the text was lost can not be closed
- **Testing underway to see if this works for closed tabs**
- OS: Windows 10
- **Testing underway to see if this works for Windows 11 builds**
- Browser: Google Chrome Version 94.0.4606.81 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- May work on previous versions of browser or OS but cannot confirm
